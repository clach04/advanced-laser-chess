If running the "web version" to stop/shutdown;
find the open CMD window and issue:

    Ctrl C
    Ctrl Break (the Pause/Break key)

There are some problems running the web front end with IE.

Known to work with FireFox 1.5.

HTML wizards are welcome to edit the template to change 
the way the interface looks.


If running an exe under Windows, the game will create (and append) to
a file called "errlog.log" in the same directory as ALC.EXE. This is 
in case of problems (mail me the file). Be aware that this file may grow
so consider deleting it every now and again (when alc.exe is NOT running).
